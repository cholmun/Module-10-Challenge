# Module-10-Challenge

## Introduction

Hi there! My name is Casey, and I am the developer behind the Module-10-Challenge repository. This project is focused on creating a command-line application that allows business owners to manage their company's departments, roles, and employees effectively.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to develop a content management system for managing employee data. The application provides an easy-to-use interface for viewing and interacting with information stored in a database, catering to the needs of non-developer business owners.

## Features

- View and manage departments, roles, and employees.
- Add new departments, roles, and employees to the database.
- Update employee roles within the database.
- Additional (TO COME) functionalities like updating employee managers, viewing employees by manager or department, deleting entities, and viewing budget utilization.
